# oBIX Java Toolkit

This as adaptation of the (public domain) "oBIX Java Toolkit" source code, repackaged with a gradle build script. 
The intended output is jar suitable for use as a library, so the "oBIX spy" parts where removed.

# Instructions

1. Just run `./gradlew build`  (or, use `gradlew.bat`, if your like, running DOS or whatever).
2. Find your `.jar` file in `./build/libs`
